We acknolwedge the use of ChatGPT [https://chat.openai.com/] to assist us in generating the Queue library, .gitignore and MakeFile

We entered the following prompt:
"Please generate a Queue library for a process queue in C"
"Please give an example of a MakeFile format"
"Please generate a .gitignore"

Although ChatGPT helped us in generating the format and structure, 
we modified the content by ourselves to suit the project specifications

Modification:
Queue Library = We incorporate the Queue library and change it to be connected with our Process library
.gitignore = No changes made
MakeFile = Changes made so all of the libraries would successfully compiled
